Upon meeting another agent:
	Pick 5 words from vocabulary (probability based on word frequency)
	If word is not in agent's vocabulary
	BASE_COPY =	.2 x MODIFIERS chance of copying word to vocabulary
	if copy successful, further .05 x MODIFIERS chance of changing each letter in the word
	update word frequency for both agents

Every 5 iterations:
	1% chance of losing each of the least frequent words in vocabulary

Modifiers
	if same class: BASE_COPY x 1.5
	if other is lower class: BASE_COPY x .5
	if other is higher class: permutation rate is x 3
	if of lowest class, 2% chance of losing each of the least frequency words
